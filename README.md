## Perform 3\-D Line Drawing in Win32 with DrawEdge


</div>

### Description

The ZATRiX Win32 DrawEdge function provides an extremely powerful, yet simple, method for drawing three-dimensional (3-D) lines. By using this function, your application can duplicate any 3-D effects found in the operating system. The main advantage of this function over your custom function is that it adapts to changes in the system colors and resolution. This function is also more likely to adapt to changes in the operating system as future versions of Microsoft Windows are released.
